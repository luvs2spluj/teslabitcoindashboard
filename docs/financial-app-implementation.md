## Key Implementation Details

### Database Optimization
- TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series data
- Proper indexing on (ticker_id, date) columns
- Compression policies for historical data
- Connection pooling and query optimization

### Data Quality
- Input validation with Pydantic schemas
- Data quality checks in ETL pipelines
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Missing data interpolation strategies

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful degradation for data sources
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Performance
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database query optimization
- Frontend code splitting and lazy loading
- CDN for static assets

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing
